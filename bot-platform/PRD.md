# Bot Platform

## Overview

The Bot Platform is a comprehensive trading and analysis system designed specifically for the GalaChain DEX ecosystem. It combines real-time blockchain monitoring, intelligent data analysis, and automated trading capabilities into a unified platform.

The system consists of modular backend services with database persistence, RESTful APIs, and a modern web interface for monitoring and control. This architecture enables both automated trading strategies and manual oversight of DEX activities.

## Development Approach

We will leverage insights gained from the three existing bots in this workspace (`basic-buy-sell-periodic`, `bollinger-bot`, and `follow-bot`) to incrementally build standalone modules. Each module will be independently testable and deployable, following microservices principles while maintaining tight integration.

The development will focus on:
- **Modularity**: Each component serves a specific purpose and can be developed/tested independently
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling as trading volume grows
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and monitoring throughout the system
- **Maintainability**: Clean code with comprehensive testing and documentation

## Core Modules

### **Block Processing**
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Connect to GalaChain Explorer API websocket to receive live block data
- **DEX Event Detection**: Identify and filter DEX-related transactions (swaps, liquidity changes, etc.)
- **Event Classification**: Categorize different types of DEX operations for downstream processing

### **Data Analysis**
- **Transaction Parsing**: Extract meaningful data from raw blockchain transactions
- **Activity Summarization**: Generate insights about DEX activity patterns, volume, and trends
- **Data Storage**: Store critical data from blocks and operations in a minimal way, keeping important details without the extra block data
- **Historical Analysis**: Maintain time-series data for backtesting and strategy development

### **GalaChain API Integration**
- **Chain Data Access**: Retrieve information about Pools, Balances, and Tokens from the GalaChain mainnet gateway
- **Real-time Queries**: Support for live balance checks, pool state monitoring, and token metadata
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper API usage patterns to respect GalaChain rate limits
- **Caching**: Optimize performance with intelligent caching of frequently accessed data

### **Trade Execution**
- **DEX Operations**: Execute swaps, add liquidity, and remove liquidity operations
- **Transaction Management**: Handle transaction signing, broadcasting, and confirmation tracking
- **Slippage Protection**: Implement safeguards against unfavorable price movements
- **Gas Optimization**: Manage transaction fees and timing for optimal execution

### **Strategy Integration**
- **Plugin Architecture**: Enable easy integration of strategy modules that work seamlessly with other platform components
- **Strategy Lifecycle**: Support for strategy initialization, execution, monitoring, and shutdown
- **Risk Management**: Built-in risk controls and position sizing across all strategies
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor strategy performance and generate detailed reports

### **Configuration Management**
- **Unified Config**: Provide consistent and well-documented configuration formats for each module
- **Environment Support**: Separate configurations for development, staging, and production
- **Hot Reloading**: Support for configuration changes without service restarts
- **Validation**: Comprehensive config validation with clear error messages

### **Testing Coverage**
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure extensive coverage of functionality through unit and integration tests
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mocking of external APIs and blockchain interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for high-frequency trading scenarios
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full system integration tests with real blockchain interactions

### **Documentation**
- **API Documentation**: Maintain cohesive and concise documentation for GalaChain and DEX interactions
- **Developer Guides**: Clear setup instructions and development workflows
- **Strategy Examples**: Sample strategies and implementation patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution guides
